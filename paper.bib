	abstract = {A procedure for synthesizing multilayered radar absorbing coatings is presented. Given a predefined set of N/sub m/ available materials with frequency-dependent permittivities in /sub i/(f) and permeabilities mu /sub i/(f) (i=1,. . ., N/sub m/), the technique determines simultaneously the optimal material choice for each layer and its thickness. This optimal choice results in a screen which maximally absorbs TM and TE incident plane waves for a prescribed range of frequencies (f/sub 1/,f/sub 2/,. . ., f/sub N/f) and incident angles ( theta /sub 1/, theta /sub 2/,. . ., theta /sub N theta /). The synthesis technique is based on a genetic algorithm. The technique automatically places an upper bound on the total thickness of the coating, as well as the number of layers contained in it, which greatly simplifies manufacturing. In addition, the thickness or surface mass of the coating can be minimized simultaneously with the reflection coefficient. The algorithm was successfully applied to the synthesis of wideband absorbing coatings in the frequency ranges of 0.2-2 GHz and 2-8 GHz.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

@article{Haghanifar:20,
	abstract = {Eliminating light reflection from the top glass sheet in optoelectronic applications is often desirable across a broad range of wavelengths and large variety of angles. In this paper, we report on a combined simulation and experimental study of single-layer films, nanowire arrays, and nanocone arrays to meet these antireflection (AR) needs. We demonstrate the application of Bayesian learning to the multiobjective optimization of these structures for broadband and broad angle AR and show the superior performance of Bayesian learning to genetic algorithms for optimization. Our simulations indicate that nanocone structures have the best AR performance of these three structures, and we additionally provide physical insight into the AR performance of different structures. Simulations suggest nanocone arrays are able to achieve a solar integrated normal and 65{\textdegree} incidence angle reflection of 0.15\% and 1.25\%, respectively. A simple and scalable maskless reactive ion etching process is used to create nanocone structures, and etched samples demonstrate a solar integrated normal and 65{\textdegree} reflection of 0.4\% and 4.9\%, respectively, at the front interface.},
